Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm w/o changing the algs structure.
Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders.
The template method design pattern involves creating an algorithm template with
processing steps relegated to child classes. The purpose is to give the child classes the
ability to specify their own steps while still remaining true to the algorithm structure.
