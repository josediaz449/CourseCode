Type: Behavioral
Purpose: The intent of a Null Object is to encapsulate the absence of an object by providing a
substitutable alternative that offers suitable default do nothing behavior. In short, a design
where "nothing will come of nothing".
Create null object class to avoid NullPointerException.
The null object design pattern negates the need to search for the null condition. This is
accomplished by creating a null object class. The null object class is designed to implement
the same interface as other classes in the package. No functionality is included in the null
object class.
