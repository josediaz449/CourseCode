Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
This results in algorithm variability depending on the calling client. This is
similar to method overloading, which allows a class to have more than one method with the same name.
