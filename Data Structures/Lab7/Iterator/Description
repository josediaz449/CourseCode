Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing
its underlying representation.
The key idea is to take the responsibility for access and traversal out of the aggregate object and
put it into an Iterator object that defines a standard traversal protocol.
