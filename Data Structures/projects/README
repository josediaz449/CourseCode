Problem and execution:
I decided to do the DNA sequence problem. The DNA class creates a DNA object that has the name and the sequence of the DNA. 
DNAMain.java has the algorithms for the longest common subsequence and the edit distance. I used the two data files that were provided
to test my program. My program scans in the files. To test the program, you will need to enter the location of the file where I have created
the file object. The scanner then gets the name of the DNA and the sequence and creates a  DNA object. It adds all of them to an ArrayList.
It then iterates through the ArrayLists and computes both the longest common subsequence and the edit distance. The program then creates a
file with the numbers separated by commas. I then used this file and created an excel sheet to find the correlations. I have these excel
files in this folder as well. 

Results:
With the small data file I found that there was a correlation of -0.858 which means there was a strong inverse correlation. This means that 
as the longest common subsequence increased, the edit distance decreased. 
For the median data file I found that there was a correlation of 0.98 which is a really strong positive correlation. This contradicted what 
the other data had shown. I figured out that the lengths of the strings in the median data file vary a lot more which is definitely affecting 
the results of the correlation because the bigger the difference between DNA sizes the bigger the Edit Distance. So in conclusion as the 
longest common subsequence increases, the edit distance decreases.
