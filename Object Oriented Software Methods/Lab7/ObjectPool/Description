Object pooling can offer a significant performance boost; it is most
effective in situations where the cost of initializing a class instance is
high, the rate of instantiation of a class is high, and the number of
instantiations in use at any one time is low.
The Object Pool lets others "check out" objects from its pool, when
those objects are no longer needed by their processes, they are returned
to the pool in order to be reused.
