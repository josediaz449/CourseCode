Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Represent a method to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new
method w/o changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
Visitor's primary purpose is to abstract functionality that can be applied to an aggregate hierarchy of
"element" objects.
New functionality can easily be added to the original inheritance hierarchy by creating a new Visitor subclass.
