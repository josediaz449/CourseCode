*Exercise 8.5. Explain the phenomenon of “inversion of control”, using the graph editor
framework as an example.
Inversion of control in a framework signifies that the framework classes, and not the application classes, are
responsible for the control flow in the application.
When you click on the toolbar, it calls the method contains to determine which icon was selected and then calls
clone. The methods contains and clone were written by the applications programmer;
the rest ot the methods are part of the framework. The applications programmer's methods are called by the
framework, not by code produced by the applications programmer. Control is not in the application
programmer's code which is an inversion of control.
