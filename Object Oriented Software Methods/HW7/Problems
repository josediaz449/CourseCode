Using them please come up with a
description
and example
for the Bridge pattern.

The Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern. It is intended to decouple an abstraction from its implementation
so that the two can vary independently. For example you can have a stove and the stove controls but by decouling the
abstraction from the implementation we can make changes to the implementation of the controls without making changes to
the actual stove or stove controls.
