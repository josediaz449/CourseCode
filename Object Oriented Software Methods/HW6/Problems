Exercise 7.19. Consider the following approach to cloning. Using serialization, save an
object to a stream and read it back. You get a new object that appears to be a clone of the
original, because all of its instance fields are distinct. Implement this approach to clone
employees with a buddy field. Verify that the result is a proper clone.

*Exercise 7.20. Give two limitations of the approach used in Exercise 7.19.
It is not good for objects that hold a lot of memory and if the class changes it will make the data unreadable.
