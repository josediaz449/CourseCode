Type: Structural
Purpose: Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat individuals objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
The whole point of the Composite pattern is that the Composite can be treated atomically, just like a leaf.
In order to implement the composite design pattern, we first create an abstract class to represent the
primitive and tree structures
