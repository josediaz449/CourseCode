Type: Structural
Purpose: Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
efficiently.
Allows you to reference a multitude of objects of the same type and having the same state, but only by
instantiating the minimum number of actual objects needed.
The flyweight design patterns offer great efficiency and improved processing when dealing with a large
number of similar objects.
