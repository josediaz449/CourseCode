Purpose: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterise clients with requests,
queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
The designer creates an abstract base class that maps a receiver (an object) with an action
(a pointer to a member function). The base class contains an execute method that simply calls the
action on the receiver.
