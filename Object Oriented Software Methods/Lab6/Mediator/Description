Type: Behavioral
Purposes: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling
by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
The mediator object: encapsulates all interconnections, acts as the hub of communication, is responsible for
controlling and coordinating the interactions of its clients.
Mediators manage the interactions between two or more objects. A real-world example is a legal mediator where
both sides of a lawsuit communicate to the mediator, but not directly to each other.
