Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object
a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain
until an object handles it.
Simplifies object interconnections. Instead of senders and receivers maintaining references to all candidate
receivers, each sender keeps a single reference to the head of the chain, and each receiver keeps a single
reference to its immediate successor in the chain.
Make sure there exists a "safety net" to "catch" any requests which go unhandled.
