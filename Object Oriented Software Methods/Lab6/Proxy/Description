Purpose: Provide a surrogate or place-holder for another object to control access to it.
A class, called the real subject, provides a service that is specified by an interface type,
called the subject type.
Proxy, in the Java context, is defined as having the authority to represent another object.
The primary justification for using the proxy design pattern is to save the tremendous
memory and processing time that is required to create complex objects.
