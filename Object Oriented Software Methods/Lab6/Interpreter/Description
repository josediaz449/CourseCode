Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that
uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
The pattern uses a class to represent each grammar rule. And since grammars are usually hierarchical
in structure, an inheritance hierarchy of rule classes maps nicely.
An abstract base class specifies the method interpret. Each concrete subclass implements interpret
by accepting (as an argument) the current state of the language stream, and adding its contribution to
the problem solving process.
