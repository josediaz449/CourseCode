Type: Behavioral
Purpose: Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalise an objects internal state so that it can
be restored to this state later.
The memento design pattern saves an object's current internal state as a memento so that it
can be referred to and restored to. If you have ever used Ctrl + Z (Windows) or Cmd + Z
(Mac) to undo a change, you were restoring to a previous state using the memento design
pattern. A benefit of using this design pattern is that we honor encapsulation, providing
data protection.
