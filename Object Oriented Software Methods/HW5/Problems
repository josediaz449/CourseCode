Exercise 6.17. Most drawing programs indicate selected items by placing “grabbers”
around the corners. Implement this feature in the scene editor by adding a method
Rectangle getBounds() to the SceneShape interface type. In the drawSelection method of the SelectableShape
class, call getBounds to determine the grabber locations. Is this an example of the TEMPLATE
METHOD pattern?
This is an example of the TEMPLATE METHOD.
